# class = blueprint for making objects
# instance (__init__) = object created from a class 
            # eg my_car = Car("red") â†’ this is one instance.

# object = another word for instance 
# oop = focuses on objects ( things with data + actions/behaviors)
# fn = reusable block of code 
# method = fn inside a class that belongs to an object 
        # eg class Dog:
#               def bark(self):
#                   print("Woof!")


# attribute = variable inside/within an object
# eg my_car.color = "red"

# property = attribute conrolled by methods 
#  Dunder methods
    #__init__(self):
